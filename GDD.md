# Game Design Document (GDD)

## 0. Working Title
**“Shards of the Withering Wilds”**  
*(Placeholder; subject to change during production.)*

---

## 1. High Concept
A **2.5D, pixel-art, roguelite hack-and-slash** inspired by *Don’t Starve*’s skewed top-down world view and survivalist tone. Players begin each run in a cozy-but-eerie **starting town hub**, interact with quirky NPCs through dialog bubbles and menus, and venture into procedurally generated "rooms" of the **Withering Wilds**. Combat layers a **rock–paper–scissors (RPS) combat triangle** atop real-time action, ensuring tactical variety. Skillful play lets players optimize each run, but depth scaling and statistical impossibility guarantee eventual defeat—fueling a compelling **meta-progression loop** of permanent upgrades, unlocks, and narrative breadcrumbs.

---

## 2. Pillars & Vision
1. **Tactically Chaotic Combat:** Fast-paced hack & slash action enriched by an underlying RPS counter-system (Melee > Ranged > Magic > Melee). Mastery matters, but hard counters and chaos prevent infinite perfection.
2. **Endless Depth, Eventual Demise:** Procedural rooms escalate difficulty beyond human limits, creating tense decision-making and thrilling close calls.
3. **Meta-Progression that Matters:** Between runs, players invest resources to unlock gear, traits, and town upgrades that shape their build strategies.
4. **Hand-Crafted Feel in Procedural Spaces:** While rooms are generated, curated rule sets ensure strong pacing, varied biomes, and meaningful choices.
5. **Don’t Starve–Inspired Visual Identity in Pixel Art:** A skewed 2.5D perspective, bleak whimsy, and expressive animation—filtered through chunky pixels and limited palettes for readability and performance.
6. **Talkative Town & Diegetic UI:** NPCs communicate via diegetic speech bubbles; menus feel like in-world artifacts. Systems are discoverable through playful interactions.
7. **Tooling for AI-Assisted Dev:** Clear, modular code architecture (Phaser 3), JSON-driven content, and promptable systems designed to work well with Claude (or other LLMs) for rapid iteration.

---

## 3. Inspirations & Differentiators
- **Primary Inspiration:** *Don’t Starve* – The angled, paper-doll view and survivalist melancholy; however, we pivot to pixel art and action combat.
- **Secondary Inspirations:** *Hades* (meta-progression & combat feel), *Dead Cells* (roguelite loop & gear variety), *RuneScape* (combat triangle), *Binding of Isaac* (room-based progression & near-impossible late-game odds).
- **Differentiators:**
  - RPS dynamic embedded in real-time combat (not turn-based choice menus).
  - Durability & consumable economy complicate loadout decisions mid-run.
  - A talkative, evolving hub town reflecting meta-progression and run history.
  - Pixel art aesthetic with skewed pseudo-isometric camera—rare combo.

---

## 4. Target Audience & Platforms
- **Audience:** Fans of roguelites who enjoy high skill ceilings, build crafting, and stylized survival atmospheres; ages 13+.
- **Platforms:** Web (desktop browsers), with possible packaging for desktop (Electron/Tauri) and mobile later.
- **Monetization (TBD):** Premium purchase or F2P with cosmetic-only microtransactions. (Decide post-prototype.)

---

## 5. Art Direction
### 5.1 Visual Style
- **Pixel Art Resolution:** Base internal resolution (e.g., 320x180 or 400x225) scaled up (x3/x4) for chunky pixels and crisp UI.
- **Palette:** Muted earth tones, desaturated greens/browns in the Wilds; warm lamplight oranges in town. Occasional saturated accent colors for VFX (magic, hitsparks) to maintain clarity.
- **Perspective:** Skewed top-down 2.5D. Ground tiles angled to give parallax-like depth; characters with slight vertical squash to imply height.
- **Animation:** Limited-frame animations with strong silhouettes. Exaggerated key frames for attacks and enemy telegraphs.

### 5.2 UI & UX Visuals
- **Diegetic UI:** Speech bubbles for dialogue; hand-drawn (pixel) panels for menus. Inventory laid out like a rucksack grid.
- **Icons:** Simple, high-contrast silhouettes for items/status effects.
- **HUD:** Minimalist—HP bar, stamina/energy bar, active weapon & durability, consumables count, room depth.

---

## 6. Audio Direction
- **Music:** Sparse, ambient tracks in town; tense, percussive loops in dungeon rooms. Dynamic layering as danger escalates.
- **SFX:** Crunchy, retro-inspired effects softened to fit the melancholic tone. Distinct cues for RPS hits (e.g., when you land a counter-advantage hit).
- **Voice:** No voiced dialogue; NPCs use short “blips” or tonal chirps accompanying text.

---

## 7. Gameplay Systems
### 7.1 Core Loop
1. **Hub Prep:** Talk to NPCs, upgrade gear/skills, craft consumables.
2. **Enter Wilds:** Choose a gate/portal and begin run.
3. **Room Progression:** Clear room → choose next branch/reward → deeper room (repeat).
4. **Death/Retreat:** On defeat (or voluntary exit), return to town; resources converted to meta-progress.
5. **Spend & Plan:** Invest in permanent upgrades (town facilities, traits, gear unlocks), then repeat.

### 7.2 Moment-to-Moment Combat
- **Real-Time ARPG:** WASD/Analog move; mouse/face buttons attack/aim. Dodge/roll with i-frames; cooldown-based skills.
- **Hit Feedback:** Enemy telegraphs, stun windows, knockback. Clear on-hit FX and floating numbers.
- **RPS Layer:**
  - **Types:** Melee, Ranged, Magic (player weapons/skills & enemy archetypes).
  - **Counters:** Melee > Ranged, Ranged > Magic, Magic > Melee.
  - **Effects:** Damage multipliers, stagger chances, or temporary debuffs when you counter correctly.
  - **UI Cues:** Subtle icons over enemies to hint type; color-coded damage numbers (e.g., green for advantage, red for disadvantage).

### 7.3 Enemy Design
- **Archetypes:**
  - **Melee Brute:** Charges, short-range bursts; vulnerable to magic slows.
  - **Ranged Hunter:** Kites, lays traps; weak to rapid melee gap-closing.
  - **Magic Wisp:** Area denial, shields; arrows disrupt casting.
- **Hybrids/Bosses:** Shift types mid-fight; layered defenses requiring gear swaps.
- **Scaling:** Health/damage scale per depth; new modifiers (e.g., “Armored”, “Regenerating”, “Explosive Death”) appear at thresholds.

### 7.4 Rooms & Biomes
- **Room Structure:** Each room is a self-contained combat arena with obstacles. Procedurally assembled from prefabs (tiles + prop sets).
- **Biomes:** Rotating themes: Rotwood Thicket (poison spores), Shiver Marsh (slow floors), Ember Caverns (lava hazards). Each biome favors certain enemy types (but never exclusively).
- **Branching Paths:** After clearing, player chooses between 2–3 door options: e.g., “Weapon Cache Room”, “Elite Fight”, “Healing Fountain”. Icons above exits communicate reward type.
- **Impossible Scenarios:** At high depths, rooms may combine tough modifiers and enemy mixes that are statistically overwhelming, ending the run.

### 7.5 Gear & Durability
- **Categories:** Weapons (melee/ranged/magic), Armor (helm, chest, boots), Accessories (rings/charms).
- **Stats:** Attack, speed, crit rate, elemental tags, durability.
- **Durability:** Decrements on use/hit. At 0, item breaks (removed or disabled) until repaired in town.
- **Repairs:** Blacksmith NPC restores durability for gold/resources. Rare on-run repair kits as consumables.
- **Loot Rarity:** Common → Legendary, influencing base stats and unique modifiers (e.g., “+10% damage to Magic enemies”).

### 7.6 Consumables
- **Types:** Healing tonics, stamina draughts, temporary damage buffs, resistance potions.
- **Run-Bound:** Reset after death. Encourage use (no hoarding between runs).
- **Crafting:** Alchemist NPC crafts better potions using run-earned reagents.

### 7.7 Meta-Progression
- **Currencies:** "Shards" (persistent), "Essence" (temporary score), “Gold” (resets each run unless banked via upgrade).
- **Upgrades:**
  - **Town Facilities:** Unlock new NPC services, improved shop stock, training dummies.
  - **Player Traits:** Permanent stat boosts (HP, speed) or passive abilities (extra dash, potion efficiency).
  - **Starting Loadouts:** Unlock new starter gear sets or extra consumable slots.
- **Narrative Unlocks:** Lore snippets, NPC story arcs, cosmetic changes in town.

---

## 8. Narrative & Worldbuilding
- **Tone:** Grim whimsy; dark forest fairy tale meets post-collapse alchemy. NPCs are eccentric survivors.
- **Loop Justification:** The Wilds "reset" due to a curse; death returns the soul to town (the last safe hearth).
- **NPC Roles:**
  - **The Tinkerer (Blacksmith):** Repairs gear, upgrades weapons.
  - **The Apothecary:** Crafts consumables, offers buffs for next run.
  - **The Archivist:** Stores lore, unlocks meta-traits via "Shards".
  - **The Gatekeeper:** Starts dungeon runs, tracks depth records.
  - **Misc. Flavor NPCs:** Provide world hints, side objectives.
- **Progressive Town Evolution:** Visual upgrades and new buildings appear as players invest, reinforcing progress.

---

## 9. Controls & Input (PC baseline)
- **Movement:** WASD / Arrow Keys
- **Primary Attack:** Left Mouse / J / Ctrl
- **Secondary/Skill:** Right Mouse / K / Alt
- **Dodge/Roll:** Spacebar / Shift
- **Interact/Talk:** E / Enter
- **Inventory/Map:** I / Tab
- **Consumable Quick-Use:** 1–4 hotkeys
- **Gamepad:** Stick for movement, face buttons for attacks/roll, shoulder buttons for consumables.

(Actual bindings customizable via settings.)

---

## 10. UI/UX Flow
- **Town HUD:** Minimal—quest markers over NPCs, player stats in a corner.
- **Dialogue:** Speech bubble appears over NPC; player choices shown as a vertical list underneath.
- **Menus:**
  - **Inventory/Equipment:** Grid with drag/drop or key-based navigation; durability bars shown on items.
  - **Shop/Upgrade Menus:** Scrollable lists with categories; confirm/cancel prompts.
  - **Run Summary Screen:** After death: depth reached, enemies slain, shards earned, notable events.
- **Onboarding:** Interactive tooltips first time a system appears (e.g., first durability loss, first counter hit). Hints can be toggled off.

---

## 11. Technical Design (Phaser.js)
### 11.1 Engine Choice
- **Phaser 3 (Stable):** Mature, well-documented, large ecosystem (plugins, RexUI, etc.) — recommended for production.
- **Phaser 4 (Beta):** Consider only if specific new features are essential; otherwise keep to 3 until 4 is stable.

### 11.2 Project Structure
```
/src
  /scenes
    BootScene.js
    PreloadScene.js
    TownScene.js
    DungeonScene.js
    UIScene.js
    MenuScene.js
  /systems
    DialogueSystem.js
    InventorySystem.js
    CombatSystem.js
    RPSLogic.js
    DurabilitySystem.js
    ProceduralGen.js
    MetaProgression.js
  /entities
    Player.js
    Enemy.js
    NPC.js
    Item.js
  /data
    items.json
    enemies.json
    dialogues.json
    rooms.json (prefabs)
  /utils
    StateMachine.js
    RNG.js
    SaveLoad.js
```

### 11.3 Scenes & State Flow
- **BootScene:** Configure game, load minimal assets.
- **PreloadScene:** Load bulk assets; show loading bar.
- **MenuScene:** Main menu, settings.
- **TownScene:** Overworld hub; NPC interactions; entry point to runs.
- **DungeonScene:** Core gameplay; generates rooms sequentially; handles combat, loot.
- **UIScene:** Persistent overlay for HUD, inventory, dialogs.
- **GameOver/RunSummary Scene:** Post-run results.

Phaser allows multiple active scenes; use UIScene as overlay (set to render on top). Pass data between scenes via `this.registry` or Phaser’s event emitter.

### 11.4 Combat Implementation
- **Physics:** Arcade Physics (no gravity). Colliders for player/enemy/walls; overlaps for hitboxes.
- **Hitboxes:** Create ephemeral sprites or bodies during attack frames to detect hits.
- **Damage Calc:** Check attackType vs enemyType → apply multiplier (e.g., 1.25x advantage, 0.8x disadvantage). Centralize in `RPSLogic.js`.
- **Cooldowns & i-Frames:** Timers or state flags; use Phaser’s time events.

### 11.5 Dialogue & Menus
- **DialogueSystem.js:** Reads dialogues.json (with NPC ids, lines, choices). Creates speech bubble graphics and text objects.
- **RexUI (optional):** For slick lists, sliders, scrolling panels.
- **Menus:** Implement as Containers with interactive Text/Button objects; toggle visibility, or open via dedicated UI Scene.

### 11.6 Inventory & Durability
- **InventorySystem.js:** Manages arrays of item objects; equip/unequip functions; emits events to UI.
- **DurabilitySystem.js:** Hooks into combat events to decrement. Handles break events (remove item, play FX).
- **UI:** Durability bars drawn via Graphics or pre-made bar sprites overlayed on item icons.

### 11.7 Procedural Generation
- **Rooms:** Prefab templates (tilemap chunks + prop spawn points). RNG picks a template; populates enemies based on depth and biome weighting.
- **Enemy Waves:** JSON defines enemy lists per depth bracket. Random modifiers applied per room (e.g., “All enemies are Ranged”, “Slippery floor”).
- **Rewards:** Weighted loot tables; ensure a steady drip of consumables/gear to support durability system.

### 11.8 Meta-Progression Data
- **Persistent Save:** LocalStorage or IndexedDB JSON blob.
- **Registry Use:** Keep run data (current depth, temp gold) in registry for easy cross-scene access.
- **Upgrade Trees:** JSON-driven; NPC menus read from these to display purchasable upgrades.

### 11.9 Tooling & AI Integration (Claude)
- **Prompt-Friendly JSON:** Content files (items, enemies, dialogs) structured cleanly. Example item JSON template that Claude can expand:
```json
{
  "id": "iron_sword",
  "type": "weapon",
  "rps": "melee",
  "baseDamage": 12,
  "durability": 100,
  "rarity": "common",
  "modifiers": []
}
```
- **Code Generation Guardrails:** Provide Claude with function signatures and subsystem APIs. Example: `CombatSystem.applyDamage(attacker, target, attackType)` docs.
- **Modularity:** Smaller files & classes so LLM can reason about them individually.

---

## 12. Content Plan
### 12.1 MVP Scope
- 1 biome (Rotwood Thicket)
- 10 enemy types (3 per RPS type + 1 hybrid boss)
- 15 weapons, 10 armors, 10 consumables
- 5 town NPCs with basic services
- Basic meta-upgrade tree (10 nodes)
- Procedural room generation with 20 room templates

### 12.2 Vertical Slice Goals
- Full loop (town → dungeon → death → meta upgrade → repeat)
- Polished combat feel (hitstop, VFX, audio cues)
- At least 1 RPS-clear advantage scenario the tutorial explains

### 12.3 Full Release Targets
- 3+ biomes, 40+ enemies, 60+ items, 30+ consumables
- Multiple bosses and mini-bosses
- Deep meta trees & visual town evolution
- Challenge modes / daily runs

---

## 13. Production Roadmap (High-Level)
1. **Pre-Prod (2–4 weeks):** Prototyping combat feel, camera, basic room generation, RPS math.
2. **Core Systems (6–8 weeks):** Inventory, durability, dialogue, NPC services, meta-progression framework.
3. **Content Pass 1 (4–6 weeks):** Biome 1, enemy set, starter items, town NPCs.
4. **Vertical Slice (2–3 weeks):** Polish first biome, UX, tutorialization.
5. **Content Expansion (8–12 weeks):** Additional biomes, enemies, items, bosses.
6. **Polish & QA (4–6 weeks):** Balance, bug fixing, performance.
7. **Launch Prep (2 weeks):** Marketing assets, store pages, build deployment.

(Adjust timelines per team size.)

---

## 14. Risks & Mitigations
- **Procedural Boredom:** Randomness can feel samey. → Use handcrafted templates + rule-based variation, not pure RNG.
- **RPS Complexity Overload:** Players may ignore counters if unclear. → Clear UI cues, tutorial pop-ups, and big feedback on advantageous hits.
- **Durability Frustration:** Overly punishing breakage leads to annoyance. → Tune durability generously; provide repair kits; communicate durability early.
- **Performance on Web:** Too many particles or physics bodies can lag. → Pooling, culling, and minimalist FX options.
- **Scope Creep:** Feature creep in meta systems is tempting. → Lock MVP, iterate post-vertical slice.

---

## 15. QA & Telemetry
- **Analytics:** Track depth reached, cause of death, gear used, potion usage rate, counter-hit frequency.
- **Heatmaps (optional):** Where do players die most? Which rooms get skipped?
- **A/B Tests:** Different durability rates or RPS multipliers to find sweet spot.

---

## 16. Glossary
- **2.5D:** 2D art/logic with perspective tricks for depth.
- **RPS Triangle:** Rock–paper–scissors style counter system (Melee > Ranged > Magic > Melee).
- **Run:** A single attempt from entering the Wilds until death/exit.
- **Meta-Progression:** Persistent upgrades across runs.
- **Biome:** Themed set of rooms/enemies/hazards.

---

## 17. Future Extensions (Post-Launch Ideas)
- **Co-op Mode:** 2-player runs with combo attacks.
- **Daily Challenges:** Seeded runs with leaderboard.
- **Mod Support:** JSON content packs; community-made items/rooms.
- **Seasonal Events:** Time-limited biomes or NPC festivals.

  const dmg = Math.floor(base * mult * randomVariance());
  target.hp -= dmg;
  showDamageNumber(target, dmg, mult);
  if (attacker.weapon) DurabilitySystem.onUse(attacker.weapon);
}
```

## 19. Sign-Off & Living Document Note
This GDD is a living document. As systems evolve and playtests provide feedback, update sections (especially balance numbers, content lists, and timelines). Maintain clear versioning and changelogs.

**Next Steps:**
- Validate core combat prototype.
- Build content JSON schemas.
- Draft initial town & dungeon scenes in Phaser.
- Begin meta-progression economy balancing spreadsheet.
